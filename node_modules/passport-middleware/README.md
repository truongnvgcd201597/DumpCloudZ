# passport-middleware

## Usage

First, you need to install the module:

```
npm install passport-middleware
```

Now you have to import the functions:
```
const {ensureAuthentication, authorization} = require('passport-middleware);
```

Let's make sure, only logged in users can access your endpoint:

```
router.get('/', ensureAuthentication, (req, res) => res.send('Hello, World!'));
```
Now, a user who isn't logged in will get a 401 status message.

You might also want to prevent people from accessing your resource if they don't have the appropriate role:

```
router.get('/', authorization(['author', 'reader']), (req. res) => res.send('Hello, World!'));
```

Now, a user with none of the roles 'author' or 'reader' will get a 403 status message. If you want to use this function, your user has to have a property named 'roles' which is an array of strings.
